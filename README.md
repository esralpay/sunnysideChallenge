### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project.Improved the general understanding of css.

```css (learned how to change .svg color)
For example
.social-media a:hover{
		filter: invert(42%) sepia(93%) saturate(1%) hue-rotate(130deg) brightness(500%) contrast(119%);
	}

```

### Continued development

css animations

### Useful resources
